## Contact Us Design

We want potential web dev clients to be able to contact us with their projects, name, tech stacks, and timelines. Create a form that they can fill out that stores this information and prints it out (for now) when submitted.

## Components to look into:

- Typography: displays and formats text
- Text Field: allows user to input text
- Box: extremely fundamental element, mostly useful for applying CS to
- Button: great for confirming a submission
- Radio Group/Checkbox: both used to let users choose from preset options. Use a Switch for only two options
- Slider: can be used to gauge difficulty 
- Stack: very helpful for managing layout, Grid is more complicated but more powerful
