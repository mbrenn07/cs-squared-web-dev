## Officers Design

We want people visiting our website to be able to see all of our officers, and for future developers to update them easily.

## Suggestions

Try making a component that serves as an officer's box, containing all the information for one officer. Possible props could be officer's name, an image link, and a description. Then map officer data to these components.

## Components to look into:

- Typography: for displaying text
- img: for displaying images
- Box: extremely fundamental element, mostly useful for applying CS to
- IconButton: Subset of Button, found on it's documentation page. Could be used to link socials/linkedin
- Stack: very helpful for managing layout, Grid is more complicated but more powerful
